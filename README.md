# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Goal

Build a PID Controller to control a Udacity car simulator. PID Controller implemented in this project responsible for calculating steering angle.
This is the part of [Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).


### PID - P, I ,D ?

- <b>Proportional coefficient (P)</b>
The role of P coefficient it to help car to drive around CTE. It is intended to reduce CTE in proportions. Lager values for this coefficient leads to faster compensating.
In experimental way I find out that 0.221 is quite enough to keep car on the track.
If only this coefficient is used, car will drive from left side to right side of the road not safely. Please, take a look at video.

- <b>Integral coefficient (I)</b><br/>
This coefficient intended to compensate systematic bias. For example if car wheels have error and constantly turn on specific angle, this coefficient helps to minimize CTE over time.
There is no systematic bias coded in simulator, so this coefficient is set to 0.

- <b>Differential coefficient (D)</b>
To make car stable and avoid constantly left-right driving, this coefficient is used. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line.
It is calculated as difference between current and previous CTE. 
At a first attempt I set this to small value like 0.3, but on hard turns car was not able to return back the middle of the road, so I increased it and stopped around 3.2.

Here is a video with a final result [P and D](https://youtu.be/Q75zgtislFE).

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
